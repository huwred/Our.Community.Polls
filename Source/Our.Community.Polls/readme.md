# Our.Community.Polls

Simple Poll Property Editor for Umbraco

## 2.0.3 Update
Added a new ViewComponent template which allows the poll to be posted using a jquery ajax post.
This allows you to implement code to prevent page scroll when a visitor votes.

## 2.0.2 Update
Added Language strings for Poll display.
If you add a dictionary item which matches the Question/Answers, they will get translated when the Poll is rendered using the viewcomponent.
